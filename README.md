## Features

From the list of software features given by the teacher, we implemented the following:

- Password strength evaluation, requiring at least 12 characters and at most 128 according to v2.1 of the ASVS and breach verification with resource of Have I Been Pwned API.

-Multi-factor authentication impemented with TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) to authorize access to the application.

-Encryption of sensitive data in the database including passwords and the key used to generate the TOTP.


## RUN

1. Create the virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```
2. Activate the virtual environment (Every time you open a new terminal you need to do this to make the virtual environment the default Python interpreter of this shell):
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
or (Windows):
```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate.ps1
```

3. Install the requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the application:


```bash
./run.sh app_org <PORT>
```
or:
```bash
./run.sh app_sec <PORT>
```

&emsp;&emsp;In Windows use instead:

```bash
.\run.bat app_org <PORT>
```
or:
```bash
.\run.bat app_sec <PORT>
```
5. Access the website:

```bash
http://127.0.0.1:<PORT>
```

6. To generate the database you need to access the following link:

```bash
/generate/all
```
